Engagement with a machine learning challenge when applied to a Data Scientist position @Spike.

Remarks follows,

- Spanish content keynote (PDF file), still graph and charts speak by themselves.

- Code outputs loss, accuracy and graph for visualization on TensorBoard.

- Code comments in English for better understanding.
